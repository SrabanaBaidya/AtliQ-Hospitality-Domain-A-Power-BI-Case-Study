# AtliQ-Hospitality-Domain-A-Power-BI-Case-Study


## Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of the codebasics September month resume challenge. The objective was to analyze and provide valuable insights for AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry facing challenges in market share and revenue loss. As a strategic move, the managing director sought to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain the lost ground. As a data analyst, I was tasked with creating metrics, developing a dashboard, and deriving insights from historical data.

### Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands faced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. The lack of effective decision-making and competition led the management to incorporate data analytics for strategic insights. With no in-house team, they opted for a third-party service provider to analyze historical data.

### Task List

1. **Create Metrics:** Develop key metrics as per the provided list.
2. **Dashboard Creation:** Design a dashboard based on the stakeholder's mock-up.
3. **Generate Insights:** Extract additional insights beyond the metric list and dashboard.
